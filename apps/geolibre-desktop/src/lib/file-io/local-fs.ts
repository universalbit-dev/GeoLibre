 * outside the `fs` plugin's runtime scope and `readFile` rejects them. The
 * command reads the file directly, so a referenced layer reloads after a fresh
 * launch instead of failing with a misleading "Could not convert this vector
 * file with DuckDB-WASM" error.
 *
 * The fall-through is deliberately broad: it covers every `readFile` rejection,
 * not just scope denials. The fs plugin does not expose a stable discriminant
 * for an out-of-scope path (only a message we would have to substring-match, and
 * a wrong guess would silently re-break the reload this fixes), so narrowing is
 * not worth the fragility. The cost is one extra IPC round-trip on a genuine
 * read failure (e.g. a moved file), where `read_local_file` fails too and its
 * error surfaces instead of the plugin's. The command validates the path on the
 * Rust side, so routing the read through it cannot widen what is readable.
