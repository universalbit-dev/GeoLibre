/**
 * Keeps a leftover text selection from hijacking map panning.
 *
 * The map canvas counts as part of a page-wide text selection. When one is
 * active, WebKit (the Tauri webview on Linux and macOS) treats a press on the
 * canvas as a press on selected content and starts a native drag of the
 * selection: the drag ghost shows whatever text was selected (for example the
 * Earth Engine control's globe emoji) and MapLibre/Mapbox stop receiving the
 * pointer moves, so the pan dies after a few pixels. Clicking any text field
 * "fixed" it only because that collapses the selection.
 *
 * The guard does what a click on a plain page area does anyway, collapsing the
 * selection when the press lands on the map, and cancels any native drag that
 * still starts from the canvas. Popups live outside the canvas container, so
 * selecting and copying their text keeps working.
